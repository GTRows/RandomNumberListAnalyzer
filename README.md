# RandomNumberListAnalyzer
This project involves creating a list of 100 random numbers in Java and then making a copy of that list. A random number between 0 and 100 is generated, and the element at that index in the copied list is removed. The goal is to develop a method that identifies which element is missing from the copied list compared to the original list.
